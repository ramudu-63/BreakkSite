<p style="font-size:24px;line-height:30px">The Breakk Privacy Policy was updated on January 01, 2015.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  Your privacy is important to Breakk and always will be so we&#146ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions. Texas does not track disclosure.

<p style="font-size:24px;">Collection and Use of Personal Information</p>
<div style="height:15px"></div>
<p style="font-size:14px">Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Breakk or a Breakk affiliated company. Breakk and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">Here are some examples of the types of personal information Breakk may collect and how we may use it:

  <ul style="margin:0 15px">
    <li style="line-height:24px">
       When you create aBreakk profile, purchase a product, download a software update, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, mobile phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information including Facebook login, VENMO, Paypal, and ApplePay information.
    </li>
    <li style="line-height:24px;margin:10px 0">
       When you share your content with family and friends using Breakk products or invite others to participate in Breakk services or forums, Breakk may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Breakk will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.

      From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about payments and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

<p style="font-size:24px">Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</p>
<div style="height:15px"></div>
<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
</p>

<div>
  <ul style="margin:0 15px">
    <li style="line-height:24px">
       We may collect information such as location, and the time zone where aBreakk product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
    </li>
    <li style="line-height:24px;margin:10px 0">
      We may collect information regarding customer activities on our iOS and Web applications. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
    </li>
    <li style="line-height:24px;margin:10px 0">
      We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.

    <li style="line-height:24px;margin:10px 0">
      With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve our app.

  <p style="font-size:14px">If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

<p style="font-size:24px">Cookies and Other Technologies</p>
<div style="height:15px"></div>
<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  Breakk&#146s online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use &#147cookies&#148 and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non &#45personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  Breakk and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  Breakk and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Breakkis more convenient and personal. Knowing your country and language helps us provide a customized and more useful user experience. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, and provide you with better customer service.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Breakk may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  In some of our email messages, we use a &#147click&#45through URL&#148 linked to content on the Breakk website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click&#45through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.

<p style="font-size:24px">Disclosure to Third Parties</p>
<div style="height:15px"></div>
<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;line-height:24px">
  We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
